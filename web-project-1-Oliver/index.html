      <h2>Just what is <i>Garfield</i>???</h2>
      <p>
        Garfield is a fat, lazy, lasagana-loving cat that was created in 1978 by
        a cartoonist known as Jim Davis. His design may have changed over the
        years, but he still keeps his monday-hating attitude more alive than
        ever before! He is recognized as one of the most widely syndicated
        comic strips in the world, appearing in over 2,000 newspapers and having
        a huge fanbase and multiple movies!
