        If you have been living under a rock, or been living like Odie, you
        might not know who I am, so let me introduce myself. My name is
        Garfield, I am a fat, lazy, lasagna-loving cat born on June 19, 1978 in
        an Italian resturant.
        <br />
        Currently, I live with my owner Jon Arbuckle and his dog Odie.
        <s>I love Mondays</s>, heck with it, I <u>HATE</u> MONDAYS!!! THEY
        <u>SUCK!</u> Well as I was saying, I also love lasagna sleeping.It is
        obvious for me. I also have a teddy bear named Pooky, who is the only
        one who understands me.
        <br />
        Well case Closed and I will continue on about me.
